## Description

The application accepts user input to collect information about the project, including the project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, application type, chosen license, GitHub username, and email address. Based on this input, the application generates a README.md file with sections such as Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing and Questions.
